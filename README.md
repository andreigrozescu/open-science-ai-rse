# AI and Open Science in Research Software Engineering

I am a Computer Science student working on this project as part of my coursework. The objective is to apply text analysis techniques to open-access research articles using Grobid. The project involves:

    -Extracting text from 10 open-access research papers.
    -Generating a keyword cloud from the abstracts.
    -Visualizing the number of figures per article.
    -Compiling a list of links found in each paper.
