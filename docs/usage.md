# Execution Instructions

To run the program, simply place the articles you want to process in the `papers/` folder. The script will analyze these papers and store the xml results in the `output/` directory, and the keyword clouds, figures and links in the `results/` directory.

Once everything is set up, navigate to the main project folder by running:

```bash
cd open-science-ai-rse
```

After that, you can execute the main script with the following command:

```bash
python3 scripts/main.py
```

This will run all the necessary scripts. After the execution, the results will be available in the `output/` directory, and additional processed results like figures and links can be found in the `results/` directory.
