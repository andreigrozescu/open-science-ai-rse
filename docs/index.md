This project, developed as part of my Computer Science coursework, focuses on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Open Science in the field of Research Software Engineering. he objective is to apply text analysis techniques to open-access research articles using Grobid. Key tasks include:

- **Extracting and processing the full text** from a set of 10 open-access research papers.
- **Generating insightful keyword clouds** based on abstracts to visualize key themes.
- **Visualizing the number of figures per article** to understand the use of visuals in research.
- **Compiling a comprehensive list of links** extracted from the papers, offering a deeper look into the references and connections within the research.


The project is designed to extract the data such as figures, links, and metadata from research papers, and it can be run either through Docker or a virtual environment.
